# Highly Ethical Coffee Machine
Highly ethical functioning coffee machine that has choice of 3 coffee. It will take a desire coffee from user
and process if it can make the product with it's limited resources. Once it confirms that it will prompt
the customer to insert/pay through coins. Calculate the coins into money and return any extra funds.
If the customer has insufficient coins it will return the money (very ethical). Once payment is process,
it will make the coffee and update it's internal report logs to show remaining resources and total funds
it has collected. Bonus: secret codes off: will shut down machine and report: will give report.
A more complex take on a simple coffee machine project.
